# About project
Booking-Testing is my first little job with testing. I used the PHP programming language as a testing tool PHPUnit.

**There are only 3 small tests in the work, and in the original code these are the results of each test:**
1. Test 1 - Passed  :heavy_check_mark:
2. Test 2 - Failed  :x:
3. Test 3 - Passed  :heavy_check_mark:

Everything is commented, so you can download the code, enter your data and check everything yourself
